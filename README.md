# Team Performance React App

This a team performance react app which create to measure the psychological safety index of the users.

The main goal of this project was to create a user-friendly app.\
I paid special attention on clean result display format of the user answers.\
It was crucial to me to make a slider survey answer with a scale from 0 to 100.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
### Jest tests

To run tests: `npm run test`.
### Backend info

I mocked the server data to easily deploy this project on netlify.\
All data used in this app can be find in db.json file.

### Additional info

I'll be focusing on developing the app's state to gather the data provided by users.\ 
Currently, I'm working on writing tests and I've already added some unit tests.\
The strategy going forward is to use either Firebase or Redux for state management within the app.

### 2023 Update

I took a break and when I came back to the project, I cleaned up the code and added the form validation for Login page I had in mind.\
Plus, I added a feature that preserves state management, ensuring all user's answers accurately display in the final results chart.
