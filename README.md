# Team Performance React App

This a team performance react app which create to measure the psychological safety index of the users.

The main goal of this project was to create a user-friendly app.\
I paid special attention on clean result display format of the user answers.\
It was crucial to me to make a slider survey answer with a scale from 0 to 100.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
